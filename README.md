# FinalGame


The main goal of this project was to create a simple game that a person can play very quickly without much instruction. I wanted the game to have a time limit, easy mechanics, and an end goal. I think with my game I have done all three and made something that the player can enjoy.

The goal of the game is to hit the ball with the paddle before it touches the ground. By using the arrow keys, you can move the paddle left and right on the screen. You have to survive 30 seconds to win the game.

I used turtle and random imports in my code. I also added in the user imputs of the arrow keys and the press to start screen. 

One thing I learned was that it was very difficult to get the ball to actually bounce off of the paddle, most of the times it would phase right through it. That was one of the main areas I found myself getting stuck in so I did lots of digging to find collision codes to help me out. I would like to improve it by adding a start screen, the one I made would crash the game and not allow it to start so I scrapped it, I would like a screen that shows instructions to the player so they know what they need to do. I would add a background next time or maybe more balls falling from the screen to make the game even more difficult. I didn't stray much from the document, just added things that needed to be added and got rid of stuff that was making the game unplayable. I stayed on track by taking ideas from the other ball drop game I made in the past and following a similar structure to that, I also watched some videos to get an idea of what the game should look like in the end.
